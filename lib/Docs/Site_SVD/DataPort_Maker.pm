 Software Version Description

 for

 DataPort::Maker - Obsolete. Superceded by File::Maker. Mimics a make by loading a database and calling targets methods

 Revision: D

 Version: 0.05

 Classification: NONE

=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Identification

This release,
identified in L<3.2|/3.2 Inventory of software contents>,
is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The system is the Perl programming language software.
As established by the Perl referenced documents,
program modules, such the "DataPort::Maker" module, extends the Perl language.

The "DataPort::Maker" provides a "make" style interface
for modules as shown below:
 
 \%targets, @targets, \%options 
 \%targets, @targets 
 \%targets, \%options

The I<\%targets> contains a list of targets that are supplied by the using
program module. The option I<-pm = file> tells "DataPort::Maker" to load
a database from the __DATA__ section of a program module that is in the
L<DataPort::FileType::FormDB|DataPort::FileType::FormDB> format.
This provides a more flexible alternative to the defines in a "makefile".

=head2 1.3 Document overview.

This document releases DataPort::Maker version 0.05
providing description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.

=head2 3.3 Changes

Changes are as follows:

=over 4

=item DataPort::Maker 0.01

Originated

=item DataPort::Maker 0.02

Adjust for the breakup of "Test::STD::STDutil" and
movement of "Test::STD::Scrub" to "Text::Scrub"

=item DataPort::Maker 0.03

Did not get everything in the last change.

=item DataPort::Maker 0.04

Fixed some things because added new common functions to DataPort::DataFile

Made some error messages more descriptive

Added lastest version for all PREREQ_PM field

Change the test so that test support program modules resides in distribution
directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory. 
Because they are no longer in the lib directory, 
test support files will not be installed as a pre-condition for the 
test of this module.
The test of this module will precede immediately.
The test support files in the tlib directory will vanish after
the installtion.

=item DataPort::Maker 0.05

The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the same
directory as the test script.
Coordiated with the lastest Test::STDmaker by moving the
test library from tlib to t/DataPort, the same directory as the test script
and deleting the test library File::TestPath program module.

Obsolete. Superceded by C<File::Maker>.

=head2 3.4 Adaptation data.

This installation requires that the installation site
has the Perl programming language installed.
There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of 
configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
installation particular to any installation site.

=head2 3.5 Related documents.

There are no related documents needed for the installation and
test of this release.
