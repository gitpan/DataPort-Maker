1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the
    "DataPort::Maker" module, extends the Perl language.

    The "DataPort::Maker" provides a "make" style interface for modules as
    shown below:

     \%targets, @targets, \%options 
     \%targets, @targets 
     \%targets, \%options

    The *\%targets* contains a list of targets that are supplied by the
    using program module. The option *-pm = file* tells "DataPort::Maker" to
    load a database from the __DATA__ section of a program module that is in
    the DataPort::FileType::FormDB format. This provides a more flexible
    alternative to the defines in a "makefile".

    The "DataPort::Maker" module is an integral part of the US DOD SDT2167A
    bundle of modules. The data used by Test::STDmaker and
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker are stored in this format.

    The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is
    as follows:

     File::FileUtil 
       Test::STD::Scrub
         Test::Tech
            DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile DataPort::Maker Test::STD::Template
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    Note the File::FileUtil, Test::STD::STDutil Test::STD::Scrub program
    modules breaks up the Test::TestUtil program module and Test::TestUtil
    has disappeared.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases DataPort::Maker version 0.01 providing
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.
