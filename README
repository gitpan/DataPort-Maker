SYNOPSIS
     use DataPort::Maker;

     $maker = new ExtUtils::SVDmaker( @options );
     $maker = new ExtUtils::SVDmaker( \%options );

     $maker->make_targets( \%targets, @targets, \%options ); 
     $maker->make_targets( \%targets, @targets ); 
     $maker->make_targets( \%targets, \%options  );

    head1 DESCRIPTION

    The "File::SubPM" subroutines shall be replaced by the appropriate
    "DataPort::Maker" subroutine whenever a "File::PM2File" subroutine needs
    a revision as follows:

     DataPort::Maker  new( )                 File::Maker    new()
     DataPort::Maker  make_targets( )        File::Maker    make_targets()
     DataPort::Maker  make_pm( )             File::Maker    make_targets()

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the
    "DataPort::Maker" module, extends the Perl language.

    The "DataPort::Maker" provides a "make" style interface for modules as
    shown below:

     \%targets, @targets, \%options 
     \%targets, @targets 
     \%targets, \%options

    The *\%targets* contains a list of targets that are supplied by the
    using program module. The option *-pm = file* tells "DataPort::Maker" to
    load a database from the __DATA__ section of a program module that is in
    the DataPort::FileType::FormDB format. This provides a more flexible
    alternative to the defines in a "makefile".

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases DataPort::Maker version 0.05 providing
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    DataPort::Maker 0.01
        Originated

    DataPort::Maker 0.02
        Adjust for the breakup of "Test::STD::STDutil" and movement of
        "Test::STD::Scrub" to "Text::Scrub"

    DataPort::Maker 0.03
        Did not get everything in the last change.

    DataPort::Maker 0.04
        Fixed some things because added new common functions to
        DataPort::DataFile

        Made some error messages more descriptive

        Added lastest version for all PREREQ_PM field

        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    DataPort::Maker 0.05
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/DataPort,
        the same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

        Obsolete. Superceded by "File::Maker".
